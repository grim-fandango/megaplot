MEGAPLOT

This MEGA65 program runs from BASIC and adds a text mode plot feature, 
similar to that found on the ZX81.  It uses the PETSCI 'Battenburg' characters to 
provide each characters space with a 4-pixel plot area, giving a total resolution,
in 80 character mode, of 160x50 pixels.

USAGE

Load the PRG - it sits at the top of BASIC at $7F00.  Switch to BANK 0 first to 
make it visible to BASIC.
